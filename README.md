### Ship Fuel Consumption & CO2 Emissions Analysis

---

#### **1. Dataset Overview**
This dataset provides a detailed view of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for various ship types operating in Nigerian waterways. It contains the following key features:

- **Ship Information**:
  - **ship_id**: Unique identifier for each ship.
  - **ship_type**: Type of the ship (e.g., Oil Service Boat, Cargo Ship, etc.).
  
- **Routes**:
  - **route_id**: Identifier for different maritime routes within Nigerian waterways.
  
- **Temporal Data**:
  - **month**: The month in which the data was recorded, allowing for seasonal analysis.
  
- **Operational Metrics**:
  - **distance**: Distance traveled by the ship in kilometers.
  - **fuel_type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., HFO, Diesel).
  - **fuel_consumption**: Amount of fuel consumed by the ship (in liters).
  - **CO2_emissions**: CO2 emissions associated with the fuel consumption (in tons).
  - **weather_conditions**: Descriptive condition of the weather (e.g., Stormy, Moderate, Calm).
  - **engine_efficiency**: Efficiency of the ship’s engine (percentage).

#### **Potential Applications**
1. **Environmental Impact Analysis**:
   - Assess the contribution of different ship types and routes to CO2 emissions.
   - Study the effect of varying weather conditions on fuel consumption and emissions.
2. **Operational Optimization**:
   - Identify routes with high fuel consumption or emissions and optimize them.
   - Evaluate the relationship between engine efficiency and fuel use.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Build models to predict fuel consumption or emissions based on ship type, route, weather, and engine efficiency.
   - Forecast operational costs under varying conditions.
4. **Policy and Regulation Development**:
   - Inform policies to regulate emissions and promote cleaner fuel alternatives.
   - Set benchmarks for engine efficiency improvements.

#### **Data Preparation Suggestions**
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Check for missing or inconsistent values in columns like `weather_conditions` and `engine_efficiency`.
  - Ensure the `fuel_consumption` and `CO2_emissions` align with distance and fuel type.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new features such as `emissions_per_kilometer` or `fuel_efficiency`.
  - Categorize `weather_conditions` for better model interpretation.
- **Visualization**:
  - Map routes using geospatial data if coordinates are available.
  - Create time-series plots to analyze monthly trends.

### **Code Implementation Section for the Project**

---

#### **1. Prerequisites**
Before running the code, you need to set up your environment with the following prerequisites:

- **Programming Language**: Python (version 3.x)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `seaborn` - For data visualization.
  - `matplotlib` - For advanced plotting.
  - `scikit-learn` - For machine learning models and evaluation.
  - `geopandas` (optional) - For geographical mapping (if coordinates are available in the dataset).
  - `statsmodels` (optional) - For statistical analysis.
  
  You can install these libraries using pip:
  ```
  pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn geopandas statsmodels
  ```

#### **2. Dataset Preparation**
- **Step 1**: Download and prepare the dataset.
  - The dataset should be placed in the root directory as `ship_fuel_data.csv`.
  - Ensure the columns match the expected structure: `ship_id`, `ship_type`, `route_id`, `month`, `distance`, `fuel_type`, `fuel_consumption`, `CO2_emissions`, `weather_conditions`, `engine_efficiency`.
  - Handle any missing or inconsistent data (e.g., incorrect fuel types, negative emissions) before proceeding with analysis and modeling.

#### **3. Data Exploration**
- **Step 2**: Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # Load dataset
  df = pd.read_csv('ship_fuel_data.csv')

  # Display basic information
  print(df.info())
  
  # Display first few rows
  print(df.head())
  ```

- **Step 3**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Data distribution visualization
  sns.pairplot(df, hue='ship_type')
  plt.show()

  # Boxplot for identifying outliers
  sns.boxplot(x='ship_type', y='CO2_emissions', data=df)
  plt.show()
  ```

#### **4. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- **Step 4**: Handle missing values and outliers.
  ```python
  # Handling missing values
  df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

  # Identifying and removing outliers
  Q1 = df['CO2_emissions'].quantile(0.25)
  Q3 = df['CO2_emissions'].quantile(0.75)
  IQR = Q3 - Q1
  df = df[(df['CO2_emissions'] >= (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) & (df['CO2_emissions'] <= (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
  ```

#### **5. Feature Engineering**
- **Step 5**: Create new features to aid modeling.
  ```python
  # Create emissions per kilometer feature
  df['emissions_per_km'] = df['CO2_emissions'] / df['distance']

  # Convert categorical variables to numerical
  df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['ship_type', 'fuel_type', 'weather_conditions'])
  ```

#### **6. Model Building**
- **Step 6**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

  X = df.drop(['CO2_emissions'], axis=1)
  y = df['CO2_emissions']
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  ```

- **Step 7**: Train machine learning models.
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

  # Initialize model
  model = LinearRegression()

  # Train the model
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)

  # Make predictions
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

  # Model evaluation
  print('Mean Absolute Error:', mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
  print('R^2 Score:', r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
  ```

#### **7. Model Validation and Deployment**
- **Step 8**: Validate the model using cross-validation.
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

  # Perform cross-validation
  scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error')
  print('Cross-validation scores:', scores)
  print('Average score:', scores.mean())
  ```

- **Step 9**: If the model meets the project’s objectives, you can deploy it using APIs or save it as a pickled file for future use.
  ```python
  import joblib

  # Save the model
  joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
  ```

#### **8. Results and Visualizations**
- **Step 10**: Create visualizations to interpret model results.
  ```python
  # Feature importance
  importances = model.coef_
  feature_names = X.columns
  feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': importances})
  feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

  sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=feature_importance)
  plt.show()
  ```

#### **9. Conclusion**
- Summarize the insights gained from the analysis.
- Discuss the impact of different factors on CO2 emissions and operational efficiency.
- Provide recommendations for stakeholders based on the findings.
- Highlight any limitations of the model and suggest areas for future work (e.g., incorporating additional variables or more sophisticated models).

### **Notes**
- **Data Handling**: Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and free of missing values.
- **Visualization**: Use visualizations to better understand the relationships in the data and to communicate results effectively.
- **Modeling**: Experiment with different algorithms if the initial model does not perform well.
- **Deployment**: Consider how the final model can be integrated into existing systems or used to generate real-time predictions.
